# Fine-Tuning LLMs and Prompt Engineering: Enhancing Performance

## Overview

This project focuses on improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through fine-tuning, advanced prompt engineering techniques, and specialized SQL tools. We worked with Palm 2 for text2SQL tasks and implemented various strategies to enhance model comprehension and generation, including the use of SQL Agents and Langchain SQL Chain.

## Key Features

1. **Fine-Tuning Palm 2**: Implemented robust fine-tuning techniques on Palm 2, tailored for text2SQL tasks.

2. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Employed sophisticated prompt engineering methods, including:

   - Zero-shot approaches
   - Few-shot approaches

3. **SQL Agents**: Utilized SQL Agents to enhance the model's ability to interact with databases and generate accurate SQL queries.

4. **Langchain SQL Chain**: Implemented Langchain SQL Chain to improve the coherence and complexity of SQL query generation.

5. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Achieved notable improvements in model performance
   - Reduced perplexity by a significant margin

## Achievements

- Successfully enhanced model comprehension and generation capabilities
- Demonstrated proficiency in crafting tailored prompts
- Achieved a substantial reduction in perplexity
- Improved accuracy and complexity of generated SQL queries

## Technologies Used
